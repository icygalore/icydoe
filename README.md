# RuPaul's Drag Race Simulator
A simulator for the reality show RuPaul's Drag Race, made with Typescript and HTML.

## Where can I play it?

Currently only at the [project's GitHub page](https://edssb.github.io/rupauls-drag-race-simulator/).

## How does it work?
For a short description, every contestant has seven mains skills (Acting, Comedy, Dance, Design, Improv, Runway and Lip-Sync). Challenges and other occurences will use these skills to determine with more accuracy how each contestant does in a specific challenge, although there's still a random element to it.

## Any planned features?

There's still some features that will be included on the project, as of now, these are:

* Team Challenges
* Thailand's Runway Challenge Format
* Untucked

There are no predictions of when these features will come, so don't hold your breath.

## Contributing
If you're interested in making any kind of contribution to the project, pull requests are always welcome.
